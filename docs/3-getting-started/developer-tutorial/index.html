<!-- TODO 
* really, should be a tutorial for MyHelloWorld so it doesn't conflict with the workflow already installed
* the adding new job step below should show how to call a user-created script! A one-step workflow!
-->

<p>This guide picks up where the <a href="../user-tutorial/">User
Tutorial</a> left off. In that previous
guide we showed you how to start up your local VM, create studies, experiments,
and samples, associate an input file with a sample, and then launch a workflow
to process that file.  These workflows can be complex (they include branching
and looping) and in future tutorials you will see how to string multiple
workflows together (output of one as input for the next) using
<kbd>deciders</kbd> for automation.</p>

<p>In this tutorial the focus is on creating a workflow of your own based on the
HelloWorld that comes bundled with the VM.  In theory you could use either a
local VM or an Amazon instance to follow the tutorial below but in our case we
will base it on the local VM.</p>

<div class="section" id="by-the-end-of-this-tutorial">
<h2>By the End of This Tutorial</h2>

<p>By the end of these tutorials you will:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a new SeqWare Pipeline workflow bundle based on HelloWorld</li>
  <li>test your workflow bundle locally</li>
  <li>package your new workflow as a bundle for hand-off to an administrator for installation into SeqWare Pipeline </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-note-about-workflow-languages-engines">
<h2>A Note About Workflow Languages &amp; Engines</h2>

<p>Workflows in the SeqWare Pipeline system can be written in one of three
languages and executed in one of two cluster environments.  The most tested
combination is <a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/">FTL</a> workflows running on
the <a href="http://pegasus.isi.edu/">Pegasus</a> workflow engine. However we have
recently added support for workflows written in Java along with workflows
written in a simplified FTL syntax. The latter of which is the least tested of
the workflow languages.  Given its flexibility and power we recommend most
users use the Java workflow language.  In addition, we have implemented a
workflow engine for submission to Oozie (Hadoop) clusters.  This is still in
testing so we currently recommend the Pegasus engine for the tutorials here.</p>

<p><img width="600" src="../../../assets/images/seqware_hpc_oozie.png"></p>

<p><strong>In this tutorial we will write a workflow using the Java Workflow Language and run it on the Pegasus Workflow Engine.  We will also show you a preview of the Oozie engine for those of you using a SeqWare 1.0.x virtual machine.</strong></p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Tip:</strong> 
In the 1.0.x release the Oozie engine will provide a very powerful way to combine traditional
NGS analysis tools with tools designed to run in a Hadoop environment so much of
our current development focuses on this new engine. If you use the development
AMI you can try the 1.0.x release and Oozie engine early.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-theory-behind-a-seqware-workflow-bundle">
<h2>The Theory Behind a SeqWare Workflow Bundle</h2>

<p>In many workflow environments the concept of a workflow is encoded as a simple
XML markup file that defines a series of steps, data inputs, etc. This may be
interpreted by a user interface of some sort, e.g. a drag-n-drop workflow
creation tool. These workflow systems tend to treat workflows as very
light-weigh representations of steps.  One problem with this lightweight
approach is dependencies for steps in the workflow, such as genome indexes for
an aligner, are often times treated as parameters and are not managed by the
workflow system.  SeqWare’s concept of a workflow is much more akin to a Linux
distribution package (like RPM or DEB files) in which all necessary components
are packaged inside a single binary file. In SeqWare we use Zip64 files to
group the workflow definition file, workflow itself, sample settings, and data
dependencies in a single file that can be exchanged between SeqWare users or
archived. This allows SeqWare bundles to be much more portable that lightweight
workflows that reference external tools and data. Being self-contained is at
the core of the design goals for SeqWare bundles with the expense of often
times large workflow bundle sizes.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="note-about-working-directory-vs-workflow-bundle-directory">
<h2>Note About Working Directory vs. Workflow Bundle Directory</h2>

<p>Just to be clear, there are two directory locations to consider when working
with workflows.  The workflow bundle directory (often referred to as
<tt>${workflow_bundle_dir}</tt> in various components) refers to the location
of the installed workflow bundle. You use this variable throughout your
workflow bundle to refer to the install directory since that will only be known
after the workflow bundle is installed.  For example, in the Java workflow
language you would refer to a script called <tt>foo.pl</tt> installed in the
<tt>bin</tt> directory within the workflow bundle as
<tt>this.getWorkflowBaseDir()+”/bin/foo.pl”</tt>.  Similarly, you can refer to
a data file in the workflow INI config file as
<tt>${workflow_bundle_dir}/data/data_file.txt</tt>.</p>

<p>The second directory is the current working directory. Every time a workflow is
launched, a temporary working directory is created for just that particular run
of the workflow.  Regardless of the workflow engine (Pegasus or Oozie) a shared
filesystem (NFS, gluster, etc) is required to ensure each job in a workflow is
able to access this shared workflow working location regardless of what cluster
node is selected to run a particular job.  Before a job in a workflow executes
the current working directory is set so workflow authors can assume their
individual jobs are already in the correct location.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="first-steps">
<h2>First Steps</h2>

<p>Please launch your local VM in VirtualBox or cloud AMI on Amazon now.  For the
local VM, login as user <kbd>seqware</kbd>, password <kbd>seqware</kbd> at this
time. Click on the “SeqWare Directory” link on the desktop which will open a
terminal to the location where we installed the SeqWare tools.</p>

<p>Alternatively, on the Amazon AMI follow the directions to log in
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html">here</a>.
Make sure that you launch our VM with the “cc1.4xlarge” instance type.
Also, please wait roughly 10 minutes for our startup scripts to run and fully setup your instance. You can verify whether the scripts have completed by looking for a touch file.</p>

<pre><code>cat /tmp/seqware_setup_ran 
date
</code></pre>

<p>The date command shows the current time, the cat command shows you when the setup script finished running.</p>

<p>Once logging into the remote instance you need to “switch user” to
<kbd>seqware</kbd>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>    sudo su - seqware
</code></pre>

<p>Both the VirtualBox VM and Amazon AMI include a start page that links to key information
for the VM such as the URLs for the installed Portal, Web Service, key file locations, etc.
On the VirtualBox VM, just click the “Start Here” link on the desktop.  For the Amazon instance
use the instance name provided by the AWS console. For example, it will look similar to:</p>

<pre><code>http://ec2-54-224-22-195.compute-1.amazonaws.com
</code></pre>

<p>You fill in your instance DNS name from the Amazon console in place of ec2-54-224-22-195.compute-1.amazonaws.com above.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="overview-of-workflow-development-using-the-vm">
<h2>Overview of Workflow Development Using the VM</h2>

<p>You should be in the /home/seqware/ directory now, this is the working
directory.  Notice there is a jar file here and also two important directories:
provisioned-bundles (SW_BUNDLE_DIR in the config) which contains unzipped
workflow bundles and released-bundles
(SW_BUNDLE_REPO_DIR in the config) which contains zip versions of the workflows
that you create when you package up these bundles and install them.</p>

<p>There are two ways to create a new workflow, the first is simply to copy an
existing workflow bundle from provisioned-bundles, rename it, and modify the
workflow to meet your needs. The second is using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html">Maven
Archetypes</a>,
a template system which generates a workflow skeleton making it fast and easy
to get started with workflow development. In this tutorial we will use the
Maven Archetypes system here since it is fast and easy. We will also test the
new bundle and, once you finish, we will package it up, ready for handoff to an
admin that will install it in the SeqWare system so users can run it.</p>

<div class="section" id="common-steps">
<h3>Common Steps</h3>

<p>Most workflow developers follow a similar series of steps when developing new workflows. Generally one goes through the following process:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <dl>
<dt>Plan your workflow</dt>
      <dd>Most developers are bioinformaticists and will spend some time exploring the tools and algorithms they want to use in this workflow and decide what problems their workflow is trying to solve.</dd>
    </dl>
</li>
  <li>
    <dl>
<dt>Find your tools and sample data</dt>
      <dd>Tools are collected, synthetic or real test datasets are prepared, prototyping is done</dd>
    </dl>
</li>
  <li>
    <dl>
<dt>Make and test the workflow</dt>
      <dd>The developer writes and tests the workflow both with bundled test data and real data locally and on a cluster or cloud resource</dd>
    </dl>
</li>
  <li>
    <dl>
<dt>Packaging and handoff</dt>
      <dd>The developer zips up the finished workflow and hands off to an admin that installs the workflow so users can use it</dd>
    </dl>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-new-workflow">
<h2>Creating a New Workflow</h2>

<p>The SeqWare workflow archetype allows workflow developers to quickly create new
workflows. The Maven archetypes generate skeletons that contain a simple
example program that can be modified to create a new workflow. The archetypes
also take parameters prior to skeleton generation that allow the name of the
workflow to be specified and all configuration files to adjusted with respect
to these parameters.</p>

<p>The code generated by the archetype contains all the necessary files to
generate a complete workflow bundle when the <tt>mvn install</tt> command is
issued. This command will combine the workflow definition, the config file, the Java workflow file, and
other external dependencies pulled in by Maven to create a complete
workflow bundle. This makes the code  generated by the archetype ideal to place
under version control. As maintenance changes are made to the Java file or any
other aspect of the workflow, these files can be updated and a new workflow
reflecting these changes can be generated by re-issuing the  <tt>mvn
install</tt> command.</p>

<p>The first step to get started is to generate your workflow skeleton using Maven 
archetypes. You will want to do this in a directory without pom.xml files (i.e. 
outside of the SeqWare development directories).  Here we are working in the workflow-dev directory: </p>

<pre><code>    cd /home/seqware/workflow-dev
    mvn archetype:generate 
    ... 
    754: local -&gt; com.github.seqware:seqware-archetype-decider (SeqWare Java Decider archetype)
    755: local -&gt; com.github.seqware:seqware-archetype-java-workflow (SeqWare Java workflow archetype)
    756: local -&gt; com.github.seqware:seqware-archetype-simplified-ftl-workflow (SeqWare FTL workflow archetype)
    757: local -&gt; com.github.seqware:seqware-archetype-module (SeqWare module archetype)
    758: local -&gt; com.github.seqware:seqware-archetype-legacy-ftl-workflow (SeqWare workflow legacy ftl archetype)
    759: local -&gt; com.github.seqware:seqware-archetype-simple-legacy-ftl-workflow (A very simple SeqWare legacy ftl workflow archetype)
 
    # select 755 above, the "SeqWare Java workflow archetype" 

    # use MyHelloWorld as the name of your workflow and use the default workflow version 

    cd MyHelloWorld 
    mvn install 
    cd target/Workflow_Bundle_MyHelloWorld_1.0-SNAPSHOT_SeqWare_0.13.6.8/ 
</code></pre>

<p>The numbers used to identify  the archetypes (754 through 759) will vary 
depending on what you have installed, so you will need to scan through the list 
to find the SeqWare archetype you are looking for, in this case “SeqWare Java workflow archetype”. </p>

<p>In this example, one would chose 755, the template for workflow using Java 
objects.  Then use “MyHelloWorld” as the artifactId and “1.0-SNAPSHOT” as the version. 
For your own workflows outside of the tutorial you would use whatever name and version 
you like. </p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="a-tour-of-workflow-bundle-components">
<h2>A Tour of Workflow Bundle Components</h2>

<p>In this section we will examine the internals of the Workflow Bundle that was just generated.
The first thing you should do is take a look at the workflow manifest showing which workflows
are present in this bundle (a single Workflow Bundle can contain many workflows).
Notice in the command below that we use the SeqWare jar from <strong>inside</strong> the workflow bundle. This
ensures we are using the version of SeqWare this bundle was built with which minimize incompatibility issues.</p>

<pre>
cd /home/seqware/workflow-dev/MyHelloWorld/target/Workflow_Bundle_MyHelloWorld_1.0-SNAPSHOT_SeqWare_0.13.6.8/

java -jar Workflow_Bundle_MyHelloWorld/1.0-SNAPSHOT/lib/seqware-distribution-0.13.6.8-full.jar  -p net.sourceforge.seqware.pipeline.plugins.BundleManager -- -l -b `pwd`

</pre>

<p>This shows one workflow in the generated workflow bundle.</p>

<div class="section" id="directory-organization">
<h3>Directory Organization</h3>

<p>The directory structure created by the maven archetype includes a
<tt>pom.xml</tt> file which is our Maven build file, a <tt>src</tt> directory
which contains the Java workflow, and a workflow directory that contains any
bundled data, the basic workflow config file which includes all the parameters
this workflow accepts, the metadata.xml which defines the workflows available
in this bundle, and any scripts, binaries, or libraries your workflow needs (in
bin and lib respectively).</p>

<p>When you issue the <tt>mvn install</tt> command the target direct is created
which contains the compiled workflow along with the various necessary files all
correctly assembled in the proper directory structure.  You can change
directory to the workflow target directory (in this case
<tt>target/Workflow_Bundle_HelloWorld<em>1.0-SNAPSHOT_SeqWare</em>0.13.6.8</tt> and
run the workflow in test mode or package up the workflow as a zip file for
exchange with others. Both topics are covered later in this tutorial.</p>

<p>The Maven archetype workflows are quite nice, too, since it is easy to check in
everything but the target directory into source control like git or subversion.
This makes it a lot easier to share the development of workflows between
developers.</p>

<h3>Workflow Java Class</h3>

<p>You can see the full Java workflow source code by looking at <a href="../../15-workflow-examples/">Workflow
Examples</a> or, in this case, just the
<tt>src/main/java/com/github/seqware/WorkflowClient.java</tt> file produced by the Maven Archetype above.</p>

<p>This Java class is pretty simple in its construction. It is used to define
input and output files along with the individual steps in the workflow and how
they relate to each other.  It is used to create a workflow object model which
is then handed of to a workflow engine that knows how to turn that into a
directed acyclic graph of jobs that can run on a cluster (local VM, an HPC
cluster, a cloud-based cluster, etc).</p>

<p>This method sets up files that are inputs and/or outputs for this workflow.  In
this example the input <tt>data/input.txt</tt> comes from the workflow bundle
itself. The ultimate location of the output file is determined by two
parameters passed into the WorkflowLauncher which actually runs the workflow:
<tt>–metadata-output-file-prefix</tt> (our <tt>output_prefix</tt> in the ini
file) and <tt>–metadata-output-dir</tt> (or <tt>output_dir</tt> in the ini
file). Alternatively, you can actually override the output location for a file
as is the case with the above “output_file”.  When this parameter is available
in the ini file the automatic location of the output file
(“output_prefix”+/+”output_dir”+/+”output”) is overridden for the value of
“output_file”.</p>

<p>In this buildWorkflow() method three jobs are created.  You can see that the
<tt>createBashJob</tt> can be used to run any arbitrary command. In the future
we will add more job types (such as Map/Reduce for the Oozie engine).  Each
child job is linked to its parent using the <tt>addParent</tt> method.  This
information is enough to correctly schedule these jobs and run them in the
correct order locally on the VM, on an HPC cluster, or on the cloud.  The more
detailed Pipeline documentation will cover optional useful job methods
including examples of how to control memory requirements for particular jobs.</p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Tip:</strong>
It can be confusing at first but there are two directories to think about when
working with workflows.  The first is the ${workflow_bundle_dir} which is the
location where the workflow bundle has been unzipped. This variable can be used
both in the Java object (via the getWorkflowBaseDir() method) and the various
config and metadata files (via ${workflow_bundle_dir}). You use this to access
the location of data and other file types that you have included in the
workflow bundle.  The second directory is the current working directory that
your workflow steps will be executed in. This is a directory created at runtime
by the underlying workflow engine and is shared for all steps in your workflow.
You can use this as your temporary directory to process intermediate files.
</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration-file">
<h3>Configuration File</h3>

<p>Each workflow uses a simple INI file to record which variables it accepts,
their types, and default values.  For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ini"><span class="c1"># key=input_file:type=file:display=F:file_meta_type=text/plain</span>
<span class="na">input_file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">${workflow_bundle_dir}/Workflow_Bundle_${workflow-directory-name}/${version}/data/input.txt</span>
<span class="c1"># key=greeting:type=text:display=T:display_name=Greeting</span>
<span class="na">greeting</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">Testing</span>
<span class="c1"># this is just a comment, the output directory is a conventions and used in many workflows to specify a relative output path</span>
<span class="na">output_dir</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">seqware-results</span>
<span class="c1"># the output_prefix is a convention and used to specify the root of the absolute output path or an S3 bucket name</span>
<span class="c1"># you should pick a path that is available on all cluster nodes and can be written by your user</span>
<span class="na">output_prefix</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">./</span></code></pre>

<p>You access these variables in the Java workflow using the
<tt>getProperty()</tt> method. When installing the workflow the ini file is
parsed and extra metadata about each parameter is examined. This gives the
system information about the type of the variable (integer, string, etc) and
any default values.</p>

<p>The ini file(s) follow the general pattern of:</p>

<pre>
# comment/specification
key=value
</pre>

<p>To achieve this overloaded role for ini files you need to include hints to
ensure the BundleManager that installs workflow bundles has enough information.
Here is what the annotation syntax looks like:</p>

<pre><code>    # key=&lt;name&gt;:type=[integer|float|text|pulldown|file]:display=[T|F][:display_name=&lt;name_to_display&gt;][:file_meta_type=&lt;mime_meta_type&gt;][:pulldown_items=&lt;key1&gt;|&lt;value1&gt;;&lt;key2&gt;|&lt;value2&gt;]
    key=default_value
</code></pre>

<p>The file_meta_type is only used for type=file.</p>

<p>The pulldown type means that the pulldown_items should be defined as well. This looks like:</p>

<pre><code>    pulldown_items=&lt;key1&gt;|&lt;value1&gt;;&lt;key2&gt;|&lt;value2&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The default value for this will refer to either value1 or value2 above.
If you fail to include a metadata line for a particular key/value then it is assumed to be:</p>

<pre><code>    key=&lt;name&gt;:type=text:display=F
</code></pre>

<p>This is convenient since many of the values in an INI file should not be displayed to the end user.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="required-variables">
<h3>Required Variables</h3>

<p>There are (currently) two required variables that all workflows should define
in their ini files. These are related to file provisioning. In your workflow,
if you produce output files and use the file provisioning mechanism built into
workflows these two variables are used to construct the output location for the
output file.</p>

<ul>
<li>output_dir</li>
  <li>output_prefix</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you have a <tt>SqwFile</tt> object can call
<tt>file.setIsOutput(true);</tt> the workflow engine constructs an output path
for this file using the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;output_prefix&gt;/&lt;output_dir&gt;/&lt;file_name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <tt>s3://bucketname/</tt> or a local path as the prefix.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="magic-variables">
<h3>“Magic” Variables</h3>

<p>There are several variables that you will see in various files, including the config ini file and <tt>metadata.xml</tt> file that are automatically defined by the system. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>${date}: a string representing the date the DAX was created, this is always defined so consider this a reserved variable name. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>${random}: a randomly generated string, this is always defined so consider this a reserved variable name. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>${workflow_bundle_dir}: if this workflow is part of a workflow bundle this variable will be defined and points to the path of the root of the directory this workflow bundle has been expanded to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>${workflow_base_dir}: ${workflow_bundle_dir}/Workflow_Bundle_{workflow_name}/{workflow_version}. This is really used in a ton of places since we need a variable that points to the install location for the bundle since we cannot hard code this.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="warning"><strong>Tip:</strong> 
Note in the testing command above it prints out the underlying command it calls using the <tt>WorkflowLauncher</tt> plugin. If all you want to do is to run a workflow with some settings without metadata writeback you could directly just call WorkflowLauncher as above. This bypasses the whole workflow scheduling and asynchronous launching process that you saw in the User Tutorial. What you lose is the metadata tracking functionality. The command runs the workflow which produces file outputs but that is all, no record of the run will be recorded in the MetaDB.

<h3>Running with the Oozie Workflow Engine</h3>

<p>For those of you using the 1.0.x (or newer) SeqWare release you can use
<a href="http://oozie.apache.org/">Oozie</a> as your workflow engine instead of Pegasus.
Oozie provides a very robust and performant workflow execution environment and,
in the future, using this workflow engine will allow for mixed workflows that
include traditional scripts along with steps using MapReduce, Pig, Hive, and
other Hadoop-associated technologies. We are also working on job submitter
plugin for Oozie that will allow jobs to be managed and scheduled by Oozie but
run on a traditional Sun Grid Engine (SGE) cluster.  Even without these more
advanced features the Oozie workflow engine provides terrific performance,
stability, and monitoring tools.  Since SeqWare workflows are engine agnostic
you can submit Java-based workflows unmodified to either the Oozie or Pegasus
engines, no workflow modifications are required.</p>

<p>There are a few caveats for the Oozie workflow engine in SeqWare.  For example,
to run the workflow above you will need to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure your .seqware/settings file includes the correct parameters. If you are using our VM this will be true.</li>
  <li>Jobs are run by the ‘mapred’ user not the seqware user. So when you author and run workflows make sure the output destination can be written to by mapred. In the future we will eliminate this constraint.</li>
  <li>Workflows include bash jobs but in the future we will add other Hadoop-specific types (e.g. MapReduce). For now these are not implemented.</li>
  <li>The monitoring tools for Oozie are far better than for Pegasus, check out Hue, for example, running on port 8888 on the VM. You can monitor and debug workflows through this very nice web interface.</li>
  <li>This engine will only work on the 1.0.0 release (or preview release) of SeqWare or newer. The 0.13.6.x and earlier releases will only work with the Pegasus workflow engine.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example the same workflow as above is executed using the
WorkflowLauncher, the underlying tool called by BundleManager when in test
mode. We use this plugin directly here since BundleManager just triggers the
test, it does not expose the workflow engine option. The <tt>–workflow-engine
oozie</tt> parameter for WorkflowLauncher executes the workflow using Oozie to
Hadoop rather than Pegasus to Condor to Globus GRAM to SGE.</p>

<pre>
<code class="language-bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> /home/seqware/workflow-dev/MyHelloWorld/target/Workflow_Bundle_MyHelloWorld_1.0-SNAPSHOT_SeqWare_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
java -jar Workflow_Bundle_MyHelloWorld/1.0-SNAPSHOT/lib/seqware-distribution-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-full.jar --plugin net.sourceforge.seqware.pipeline.plugins.WorkflowLauncher -- --no-metadata --provisioned-bundle-dir <span class="sb">`</span><span class="nb">pwd</span><span class="sb">`</span> --workflow MyHelloWorld --version 1.0-SNAPSHOT --ini-files Workflow_Bundle_MyHelloWorld/1.0-SNAPSHOT/config/workflow.ini --workflow-engine oozie --wait</code>
</pre>

<p>This will cause the workflow to run and not exit until it finishes (the
<tt>–wait</tt> option).  You can also monitor the workflow using the Hue web
application installed at http://hostname:8888/oozie/. For our VMs the username
and password are “seqware”. This is a great way to monitor and debug workflows,
you can very easily get to the logs for each step, for example.</p>

<p>The Oozie engine will continue to evolve over time and will become our default
workflow engine in the 1.x series.</p>

<h2>Packaging the Workflow into a Workflow Bundle</h2>

<p>Assuming the workflow above worked fine the next step is to package it.</p>

<pre><code>[seqware@seqwarevm Workflow_Bundle_MyHelloWorld_1.0-SNAPSHOT_SeqWare_0.13.6.8]$ mkdir ~/packaged-bundles
[seqware@seqwarevm Workflow_Bundle_MyHelloWorld_1.0-SNAPSHOT_SeqWare_0.13.6.8]$ java -jar ~/seqware-distribution-0.13.6.8-full.jar -p net.sourceforge.seqware.pipeline.plugins.BundleManager -- --b ~/packaged-bundles -p `pwd`
Running Plugin: net.sourceforge.seqware.pipeline.plugins.BundleManager
Setting Up Plugin: net.sourceforge.seqware.pipeline.plugins.BundleManager@20b9b538
Packaging Bundle
Bundle: packaged path: /home/seqware/workflow-dev/MyHelloWorld/target/Workflow_Bundle_MyHelloWorld_1.0-SNAPSHOT_SeqWare_0.13.6.8
Bundle Has Been Packaged to /home/seqware/packaged-bundles!
</code></pre>

<p>What happens here is the <code>Workflow_Bundle_hello_1.0-SNAPSHOT_SeqWare_0.13.6.8</code> directory is zip’d up to your output directory and that can be provided to an admin for install. In this VM you will find the bundled workflow written to the file /home/seqware/packaged-bundles/Workflow_Bundle_MyHelloWorld<em>1.0-SNAPSHOT_SeqWare</em>0.13.6.8.zip</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="next-steps">
<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>The next step is the <a href="../admin-tutorial/">Admin Tutorial</a> which will show you how to install the workflow created above so other users can call it.</p>
